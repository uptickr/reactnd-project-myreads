## `MyReads: A Book Tracking App`
Submission for React Fundamentals assignment in [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
Project is forked from the provided [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

This app allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The information persists as you interact with the application.

### Setup
* Fork, clone or download the repo
* Run ```yarn install``` and ```yarn start``` to start the project in development mode

### Backend server
The app depends on a backend server provided by Udacity.

### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
